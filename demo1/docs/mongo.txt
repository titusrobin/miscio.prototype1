Current History Managment 

A. User collection
- Each user has a unique document in collection. 
- Each user gets their own thread id. 

B. Chat collection (DOES THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE TO ADMIN CHAT?)
- Stores thread_id and chat message by assistant/user. 




### Admin's perspective:
- My user account information is saved
- My chat history with my assistant is saved (Contextualization) 

- Student campaigns I run need to be stored individually 

>>> I want access to student chat history by campaign details / Updated assistant, Multiple func calling setup might be different from single func calling
>>> Initial Conversation is dynamic based on student history
