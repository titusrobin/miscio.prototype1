Current History Managment 

A. User collection
- Each user has a unique document in collection. 
- Each user gets their own thread id. 

B. Chat collection (DOES THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE TO ADMIN CHAT?)
- Stores thread_id and chat message by assistant/user. 




### Admin's perspective:
- My user account information is saved
- My chat history with my assistant is saved (OPENAI HOSTS HISTORY - LOC EG)
- Student campaigns I run need to be stored individually 
- I want access to student chat history

>> I want the campaigning threads and student chat history stored - need a schema for this. 
    (Can we not use a new assistant with an existing thread?)
    (How to store campaign specific history into the same thread): student assistant v student thread 
>> Initial message needs to be changed (history basis)
