- TwiML (the Twilio Markup Language) is a set of instructions you can use to tell 
Twilio what to do when you receive an incoming call, SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp message.

- When a message arrives at your Twilio phone number, 
Twilio sends a request to your web application using the webhook URL that you've specified.
